Hello, Michael,
Great!
The plan with Celestial Brewery is to resume the project in August, 
assuming that both UD and the brewery are open.
Best wishes,
Dr. Olenick

                Okay.  I've attached one paper on debris that has some
                of the physical ideas for it.  What I think would be
                most useful would be to produce the light curve (light
                flux versus time) for debris at different distances,
                planes, etc. around a binary star.  No one has done this
                and I hope that it is not an insurmountable project. 
                Basically to get the flux, we need to know the area of
                the debris and temperature then use the Plank radiation
                law to find the flux.  All that will involve integrating
                over the debris, if it is elongated.  But I would first
                start with a few small objects in orbit around the
                binary.  Have a variable angle for the plane of their
                orbit from the orbital plane of the binary, as well as
                distance from the barycenter of the system.  (Don't be
                frightened, barycenter is really the center of mass of
                the binary system in this case since the debris mass
                will be small compared to the masses of the planets.  In
                the light curve we also need to take into account the
                flux from the two stars, which will alternately pass in
                front of each other.<br class="">

I don't think I replied to your request since I was in the midst of Mayterm.  I thought about projects and, if you are still looking for one, I have the following:
1.  Revise, complete and increase the size capacity of a program that Nate Smith developed last summer called eclipse mapping, which takes photometric data (light intensity over time) and produces a 2D map of the accretion disc in a binary.  The work was done in Python and is on Github:  <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://github.com/elUser81">https://github.com/elUser81</a>

2.  Use gravitational interactions (like we did with an asteroid belt) to model the formation of an accretion disc in a binary system.  You would need to include collisions (friction) between particle in some way.  Most methods use 3D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics but I think we can develop a more basic, direct model.

3.  Model debris in orbit about a binary system to produce synthetic light curves (intensity versus time).

Again, I am sorry that I didn't reply in a timely manner!  If you have moved on to another project, just let me know.  If you are interest in one of these, I can provide more information and a starting point.
